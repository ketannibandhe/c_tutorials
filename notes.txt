(1)int a=9 b=8;
int x,y=a*b; 
here value of a*b is assigned to y and remains undeclared

(2)1.6 % 2.0 is invalid because modulo operator works only for integers

(3)type conversion from double to int is not possible

(4)in type conversion rounding of is NOT done 
1.99999 is not converted to 2,it i changed to 1

(5)the statement 8^8 is a valid statement and considered as XOR operator

(6)we cannot declare and use the variable in a same line

(7)function takes value as input as a parameter and pass the 
result as a return value

(8)passing arguments to the function:-
1.void avg(); it returns noting so that's why returntype is void. 
2.void avg(int n);
3.int avg(int a,int b,int c); this will return (a+b+c)/3 
here int is a returntype

(9)difference between arguments and parameters
(10)function can return only one value at a time
(11)memory is full and programme will crash this means stack overflow
(12)pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable
(13)*ptr: *is value at address operator
    &age: &is address of operator
(14)when we enter the index greater than the arraysize,
then it will show an index error.

(15)scanf can't take multiword string as an input
(16)We cannot change the value stored in the array by directly using the 
assignment operator"=".
